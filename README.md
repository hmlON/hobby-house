## Description
HobbyHouse is an application for sharing your hobbies with the world. It is designed for people to share information about things they are interested in, their hobbies, and find new information about them.  
Everyone has their hobbies and at some point would like to share their achievements in them with everyone. Then people start writing about their hobbies in social networks, but only friends can see that and people want to share with all like-minded people. This is why we are developing this project.  
In this application users can create an account and after that can join to their hobbies topic or create if application doesn’t have one. Then they can create posts with their stories or some professional tips, etc. Authenticated users can comment and upvote other people’s posts or join new topics. If someone doesn’t want to register, he can still watch some specific topics, but can’t create topics and comment other peoples’ posts.  
This application will be useful for people who want to share their knowledge, talents or want to get experience from other people.
